# DED_AI_Client

## Project setup
```
npm install
```

## Compile and run development server
```
expo start
```

## Launch application
Once the server is running, the easiest way to lauch the app is using [Expo Go](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=host.exp.exponent&pli=1) in a physical device. On the other hand, an Android/iOS emulator can be used.
